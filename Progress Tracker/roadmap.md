## ✅ Topic-Wise Checklist

### 📅 **July: Arrays, Strings, Hashing**
- [ ] Arrays (Kadane’s, Prefix Sum, Sliding Window)
- [ ] 2D Arrays (Search, Diagonals, Spiral traversal)
- [ ] Strings (Anagram, Palindrome, Substring problems)
- [ ] Hashmap (Freq count, Longest sequence, Grouping)
- [ ] Sliding Window / Two Pointer (Pattern match, Max sum)
- [ ] Bit Manipulation (Basics, Even/odd, XOR swap)

---

### 📅 **August: Recursion, Backtracking, Trees**
- [ ] Recursion fundamentals (Base case, stack tracing)
- [ ] Backtracking (N-Queens, Word search, Permutations)
- [ ] Binary Trees (DFS/BFS, Height, Diameter)
- [ ] BST (Insert/Delete/Search, Kth smallest, Lowest Common Ancestor)
- [ ] Tree-HashMap (Vertical order, Path sum, Build tree)
- [ ] Linked Lists (Reverse, Cycle detection, Merge sort)

---

### 📅 **September: Graphs, Heap, Greedy, Bit**
- [ ] Graph Traversal (DFS, BFS, Connected components)
- [ ] Topological Sort (Kahn’s algo, DFS-based)
- [ ] Union Find (Path compression, Kruskal's MST)
- [ ] Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford (SSSP)
- [ ] Heap / Priority Queue (K largest, Median stream)
- [ ] Greedy (Activity selection, Gas station, Jump game)
- [ ] Bit Manipulation (Bitmask DP basics)

---

### 📅 **October: Dynamic Programming, Intervals, Tries**
- [ ] DP – 1D (Climb stairs, House robber, LIS, Frog jump)
- [ ] DP – 2D (Knapsack, LCS/LCSubstring, Grid paths)
- [ ] DP on Trees / Memoization
- [ ] Intervals (Merge, Insert, Meeting rooms, Overlaps)
- [ ] Tries (Insert/Search, Word autocomplete, Word break II)
- [ ] Suffix arrays / Rolling hash (only if time permits)

---

## 🧠 **November: ML Prep + Case Studies + Light System Design**
- [ ] ML pipeline (EDA → Prep → Modeling → Tuning)
- [ ] Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Clustering
- [ ] Metrics: AUC, RMSE, Logloss, Precision, Recall, Gini
- [ ] Feature engineering, Data leakage, Handling imbalance
- [ ] Case studies: Conversion optimization, Personalization, Churn
- [ ] Googleyness + Behavioral questions
- [ ] System Design basics (HLD: recommendation, logging)

---

## 🏁 **December: Mock Interviews + Final Polish**
- [ ] Full-length timed mock interviews (LeetCode, Pramp, peers)
- [ ] Resume + GitHub cleanup
- [ ] Last 2 weeks: high-frequency LeetCode patterns
- [ ] Review of weak topics + revisit mock feedback
- [ ] Final polish and confidence building
